WeTransfer is the simplest way to send your files around the world. We offer a free service (“WeTransfer Regular”) as well as a subscription Plus service (“WeTransfer Plus”), including additional features and functionalities (together: the “Services”). The Services are provided to you, the user of the Services, by WeTransfer B.V. (“WeTransfer”, “We”, etc.), with its main office at Oostelijke Handelskade 751, 1019 BW Amsterdam, the Netherlands, registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under 34380998. To enable easy reading of this document, we have separated the text into a left column, with the binding text in ‘legal speak’, and a right column, with the non-binding text in simple speak. We hope this helps you to get a good understanding of what we offer you, what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.

Uploaded files are stored and available to download on WeTransfer’s servers for a limited period of time and will expire automatically after.

Each e-mail is sent separately to each individual recipient.
After the expiry period mentioned in clause 2.4, WeTransfer will permanently delete the uploaded files. These files will not be available nor retrievable anymore.
WeTransfer Plus
WeTransfer Plus provides a subscription service that a.o. - compared to WeTransfer Regular - allows you to upload larger file sizes to more recipients and keep transfers stored for the duration of your Plus subscription. You can find the current specific characteristics here. <ch2>In addition, WeTransfer Plus provides you with additional features that WeTransfer may change or expand from time to time.</ch2> 3.1 If you use WeTransfer Plus you can send tons of large files and keep them available online for the duration of your Plus subscription.
WeTransfer offers annual and monthly subscriptions. The subscription fees for the respective subscription terms can be found on the WeTransfer website.
To use WeTransfer Plus, you must register for an account on the WeTransfer Plus sign up page, by filling in your personal details, e-mail address, password and payment method and details. Should registrations appear to be untruthful; WeTransfer holds the right to delete the account. 3.3 We are open and clear about who we are and would like the same from you. Keep your details up to date and to yourself. We'll remember who you sent stuff to, to make life easy.
In case of any changes in personal details, you are requested to update the information in your profile immediately.
<ch2>We may change the content of the WeTransfer Plus services or the subscription fee from time to time.</ch2> Any price changes will apply to you no earlier than one month following our notice to you.
WeTransfer Plus payment conditions
The initial subscription term starts once you have registered and the fees due have been paid in full. 4.1 You will be billed for the chosen subscription term in advance. If we cannot collect the payment for whatever reason, we will notify you and cancel the provided services.
Depending on the subscription term chosen, the fee for the subsequent Services and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services will be charged (per billing term) within the week prior to the calendar day corresponding to the anniversary date of your subscription.
Depending on the payment method you use, the issuer of the payment method may charge you certain fees relating to the processing of your payment.
You acknowledge that the amount billed each subscription period may vary for reasons that may include but are not limited to differing amounts due to promotional offers or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax or exchange rate, and you authorize WeTransfer to charge you for such varying amounts. WeTransfer notifies you via the email address you provided us when the payment of your (next) account fee has been charged.
You can change your payment method in your account settings.
<ter2>WeTransfer may suspend or cancel the Services to you if a payment is not successfully settled, for instance in case of insufficient funds, expiration of credit cards, changed payment details or otherwise.</ter2>
Term and cancellation of WeTransfer Plus subscription
The subscription period will be renewed automatically for the selected subscription period, unless you have set it to renew manually, or if you have cancelled your subscription in time in accordance with this clause. 5.1 Your subscription will automatically renew for the selected term, unless you don’t want it to.
You may deactivate your subscription at any time. To do so, deactivate ‘automatic renewal’ in your account settings or send an e-mail to Support. 5.2 If you don't want your account to be automatically renewed, adjust this in your account settings before we charge. If you don’t renew or if you deactivate your account, your Plus account will expire.
In case of cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your paid subscription period. You do not have any right to reimbursement of (part of) the subscription fee, unless local mandatory consumer law obliges to do so. 

for instance: if the date of commencement of your monthly subscription is 2 February and you cancel your subscription on 17 October, your subscription will continue until 2 November.
Upon cancellation (and after the end of your subscription period) or if a payment is not successfully settled (for instance due to expiration or insufficient funds), your account will be deactivated. You will then not have access to your personal data, address book and any files stored for transfer. You can reactivate your subscription at any time in your account settings by making payment within four weeks after deactivation. Your subscription will then be renewed as from the day of reactivation. 5.4 If you stop your subscription, we will deactivate your account and you have four weeks to reactivate it. After this period we will no longer keep your data.
If you do not reactivate your subscription within the term set out in clause 5.4, your Plus features including your personal content, settings, address book and any files stored for transfer will be automatically and permanently deleted.
Confidentiality
Any file transfer between you and recipients is treated confidentially. WeTransfer does not provide any public search function, catalogue or listing to find transfers that would be available. As a Plus user you can search your own transfers. 6.1 We treat your stuff with respect. We don’t let anyone search for anything on the website. Be mindful of where and how you share download links. When someone has access to a download link, they have access to the transfer it links to.
WeTransfer will not look into your transfer or files, unless this is necessary and in line with our Privacy & Cookie Statement, for instance to provide you with (technical) support on your request or if we are by law obliged to do so.
You acknowledge that download links can be forwarded and - whoever is passed on or has access to a download link can download the files contained in that transfer. WeTransfer Plus offers the option to protect transfers with a password, which is only stored encrypted and not accessible for anyone. It's the responsibility of the uploader to share said password. 6.3 Please be careful to distribute download links - whoever is passed on or has access to a download link can download the files contained in that transfer.
