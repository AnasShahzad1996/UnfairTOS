Please read these Terms carefully before using the Site and the Product.

It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. <use2>Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.</use2>

3. Services.

Each Product available for purchase consists of different bundles. The following terms apply to each bundle component.

(a) Device

Product purchases made through the Site are intended for end users only, and are not authorized for resale. Ava reserves the right not to accept your order in its sole discretion. After you place an order, you will receive a confirmation email from Ava, constituting Ava’s acceptance of your order. <ltd2>You agree that any scheduled shipment dates are estimates only, and Ava shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery.</ltd2> Ava will pack the Products in accordance with its standard practices. Title to the Products and risk of loss will pass to you upon Ava’s delivery of the Products to the carrier.

(b) Webinar

Certain bundles provide you with access to regular webinars on the topics of fertility, trying to conceive, and pregnancy using a technological third-party service provider such as Zoom (collectively, “Webinars”). These webinars are available via live participation or by recording. Ava will make best efforts to notify you in advance of a new Webinar but is not required to. <ch2>Ava reserves the right to post, modify or discontinue any Webinars available on its Site at its sole discretion and without prior notice.</ch2> You may not download or otherwise copy the Webinars for any business purposes and distribute them without Ava’s prior written consent.

(c) Consultations

Certain bundles provide you with a defined amount of time (“Minutes”) for an individual consultation with an Ava-certified, independent fertility coach (“Coach”). Please note that the Coach is not a medical professional and does not provide any medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. The consultations are conducted via a video call using a third-party service provider and must be scheduled at least 48 hours in advance on the Site. <ch2>The number of Minutes shall be set forth in Ava’s product offering on the Site and may change from time to time.</ch2> You may allocate your available Minutes to one or more calls with pre-set durations as set forth by Ava. If a call exceeds your available Minutes, you can purchase follow-up packages of additional minutes on the Site.The exact time slots and follow-up packages are subject to change. You may cancel or reschedule an appointment up to 24 hours before the scheduled time. Cancelations or rescheduling after that point, as well as no-shows, lead to a subtraction of the originally scheduled time from the customer’s call credit.

(d) One Year Money-Back Guarantee

Certain bundles provide you with a limited one-year guarantee of your money back if you do not get pregnant within one (1) year of using the Products, subject to the following conditions:

    Your Device has been shipped to between twelve (12) and fifteen (15) months ago from the date of your claim;
    You are the original purchaser of the Device;
    You did not get pregnant since the Device was shipped to you (Ava reserves the right to require a confirmation from a medical professional);
    Ava has received your returned Device in accordance with its routine return policy; and
    You have worn the Device regularly. We require that you synced your Device an average of 80% of your cycles across all your complete cycles during the first twelve (12) months of using the Device. A cycle is considered ‘complete’ when both the first day of your menses and the last day before the next menses are within the 12-month timeframe of first using the Device. In case of the unfortunate event of a pregnancy not carried to term, your time in pregnancy mode in the app will be regarded as one complete cycle. Days where Ava makes it impossible for you to wear the Device (e.g. during replacement shipping) or where you have technical syncing issues, count as synced days.

4. Pricing and Payment.

Any prices listed on the Site are in the currency as stated on the Site and do not include any shipping and handling charges or applicable taxes and may change at any time. Ava can withdraw Products from the Site at any time and for any reason.

We accept the payment methods indicated on the Site. You must provide current, complete and accurate billing and payment information. In certain instances, the issuer of your credit card or your payment provider may charge you a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. We do not accept any payment method not indicated on the Site, including without limitations cash, check, money orders, ACH, debit cards or bank wires, unless you have prior written authorization from Ava to use such a payment method. You shall be responsible for all applicable taxes that arise in any jurisdiction, including without limitation, value added, consumption, sales or other taxes, fees, duties, or charges imposed on the sale of the Products (collectively, “Taxes”). You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, on any outstanding balance.

The countries where Ava is available for sale are indicated on the Site. Ava reserves the right to cancel any orders at any time in its sole discretion. In case of such a cancellation by Ava, Ava will not charge your credit card or other payment method, as long as the Products are not delivered to you as of the time of the cancellation.

Discount codes cannot be combined. Limit one per customer.

5. User Manual.

There is an online user manual (www.avawomen.com/getstarted) that contains various important information related to the optimal use and maintenance of your Device, including without limitation technical specifications, use instructions and service communication (“User Manual”). The App may contain additional explanations relating to the use and maintenance of the Device (“App Instructions”). You represent and warrant that you have read and understood the User Manual and the App Instructions, and you agree that Ava is not responsible, under the Warranty below or otherwise, for damage or non-performance from failure to follow the User Manual or any other instructions relating to the use of the Device.

6. Limited Warranty.

The warranty offered herein by Ava (the “Warranty”) gives you specific legal rights, and you may have other legal rights, including those under consumer laws, which may vary in different jurisdictions. To the extent permitted by law, this Warranty and the remedies set forth are exclusive and in lieu of all other warranties, remedies and conditions, whether oral, written, statutory, express or implied. Ava disclaims all statutory and implied warranties, including without limitation, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and warranties against hidden or latent defects, to the extent permitted by law. In so far as such warranties cannot be disclaimed, Ava limits the duration and remedies of such warranties to the duration of this express Warranty (to the extent permitted by law) and, at Ava’s option, the repair or replacement services described below (which includes the Device as well as the other Products). Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty (or condition) may last, so the limitation described above may not apply to you.

Ava warrants to the original purchaser that the Device will be free from material defects in workmanship and materials under normal use for a period of one (1) year from the date of your purchase, unless longer minimum periods are required under mandatory laws in your jurisdiction (“Warranty Period”). This Warranty applies to hardware products and accessories marked with the “Ava” trade name or logo and containing a valid Ava serial number which were sold/purchased on the Site or from an authorized reseller.

If you submit warranty claims to Ava before the end of the Warranty Period and your Device clearly and verifiably fails the warranty, Ava will, in its sole discretion: (i) refund you in the amount of the price you paid for the Device (excluding taxes and shipping costs); (ii) exchange the Device with a new or refurbished Device (exchange the Device of identical specifications or functional equivalent); or (iii) repair the Device. This Section sets forth your sole and exclusive remedy, to the extent permitted by law. Returns shipped without Ava’s prior express return authorization will not be accepted.

If a Device has been exchanged or repaired following this Warranty, it will be subject to a warranty for either: (i) the remaining original Warranty Period; or (ii) thirty (30) days from the date of repair or replacement or for any additional period of time that is applicable in your jurisdiction.

You must deliver the Device to the address specified by Ava in either its original packaging or packaging providing an equal degree of protection. In accordance with applicable law, Ava may require that you furnish proof of purchase details and/or comply with registration requirements before any warranty service is rendered. It is your responsibility to synchronize any data stored on the Device. It is likely that such data will be lost or reformatted during service, and Ava will not be responsible for any such damage or loss. Ava is not responsible for lost or damaged return shipments. You assume responsibility for the payment of any shipping charges and for all risk of loss or damage to the Device during shipment to Ava.

This Warranty does not apply to, and explicitly excludes, the following: (a) consumable parts, such as straps, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship in the Device; (b) normal wear and tear and cosmetic damage, including, but not limited to, scratches, dents, damaged packaging material or damaged plastic parts; (c) defects or damage caused by alteration, unusual stress, accident (including, without limitation, collision, modification fire and the spillage of food or liquid), neglect, abuse, misuse, improper or unauthorized repair, installation, wiring, improper storage or testing, use of third party accessories such as straps or cables, third-party applications downloaded to the Device or if the serial number has been removed; (d) damage caused by using the Device outside the permitted or intended uses described by Ava; (e) damage caused by use with non-Ava products; (f) any non-Ava hardware products or any software, even if packaged or sold with the Device; and (g) modifications of the Device by anyone other than Ava. Ava reserves the right to disable Device if Ava suspects nonconformity, fraud, or if Ava finds out that the Device is counterfeit, stolen or lost in shipment. This Warranty does not cover the software embedded in the Device and the services provided by Ava to owners of the Device, nor your use of the Site and the application provided by Ava.

In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Warranty enclosed in the Device package at time of purchase, these Terms shall control.

7. Compatibility.

You acknowledge that you have verified the compatibility of the Devices you are purchasing with other required equipment (e.g., ensuring that your mobile device and/or operating system is compatible with the Device). You are solely responsible for determining the compatibility of the Devices with other equipment, and you accept that lack of compatibility is not a valid claim under the warranty provided with your Devices.

Similarly, you acknowledge that the Device comprises a bracelet with the measurement as specified on the Site. You are required to check your correct wrist size before buying the Device, and communicate with the Ava customer service if needed. You are solely responsible for determining that the size is right for you, and you accept that wrong size is not a valid claim under the Warranty provided with your Devices.
