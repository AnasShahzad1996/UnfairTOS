6.
HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED
The information set out in the Terms and the detail contained on this website do not constitute an offer for sale, but rather an invitation to treat.
No contract in respect of any items will exist between us and you until your order has been expressly accepted by us, whether or not funds have been deducted from your account.
If we do not accept your offer and funds have already been deducted, these will be fully refunded.
To place an order, you must follow the online shopping process and click on "Authorise payment" to submit the order.
After this, you will receive an email from us confirming receipt of your order (the "Order Confirmation").
Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.
Your order constitutes your offer to us to buy one or more items from us.
All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm this acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the item is being sent (the "Shipping Confirmation").
The contract for the purchase of an item between us (the "Contract") will only be formed when we send you the Shipping Confirmation.
The Contract will relate only to those items whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation.
We will not be obliged to supply any other items which may have been part of your order, until the dispatch of those items has been confirmed in a separate Shipping Confirmation.
7.
AVAILABILITY OF ITEMS
All orders for items are subject to availability and in this regard, in the event of supply difficulties or because items are no longer in stock, we reserve the right to give you information about substitute items of an equal or higher quality and value which you can order.
If you do not wish to order the substitute items we will reimburse any monies that you may have paid.
8.
REFUSAL OF ORDER
We reserve the right to withdraw any items from this website at any time and/or remove or edit any materials or content on this website.
Whilst we will use our reasonable endeavours to process all the orders submitted to us, there may be exceptional circumstances which mean that we may need to refuse to process or accept an order after we have received it or sent you an Order Confirmation, which we reserve the right to do at any time.
We will not be liable to you or any other third party by reason of our withdrawing any item from this website, removing or editing any materials or content on this website, or for refusing to process or accept an order after we have received it or sent you an Order Confirmation.
9.
DELIVERY
Subject to availability (see Clause 7 above), and unless there are any exceptional circumstances, we will endeavour to fulfil your order for items listed in the Shipping Confirmation by the delivery date set out in the Shipping Confirmation or, if no estimated delivery date is specified, then within a maximum of 30 days of the date of the Order Confirmation.
If we fail to deliver the items within 30 days of the date of the Order Confirmation, you may cancel the Contract and we will reimburse you the price paid for the items and any delivery costs paid.
If our supply of the items is delayed by an event outside our control, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know, and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay.
Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the Contract and receive a refund for any items you have paid for but not received.
With regard to the virtual gift card, we will send it on the date indicated by you when you place your order.
Please note however that we do not deliver on Saturdays or Sundays, except in the case of the virtual gift card which will be delivered on the date indicated by you.
For the purpose of these Terms, "delivery" or "delivered" shall be deemed to have occurred when you or a third party nominated by you acquires physical possession of the items, which will be evidenced by the signing for receipt of the items at the agreed delivery address.
The virtual gift card shall be deemed to be delivered in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Gift Card, and in all cases on the delivery date of the virtual card to the e-mail address indicated by you.
10.
UNABLE TO DELIVER
If we are unable to deliver, your items will be returned to our depot.
We will leave a note explaining where your parcel is and how you can rearrange delivery.
If you are not at the delivery location at the time agreed, please contact us again to rearrange delivery for another mutually convenient day.
If after 15 days from the date your order is available for delivery, the order could not be delivered for reasons not attributable to us, we will assume that you wish to cancel the Contract and it will be terminated.
As a result of the termination of the Contract, we will return to you all payments received from you, including delivery charges (except for any additional costs resulting from your choice of any delivery method other than the ordinary delivery method that we offer) without any undue delay, and at any rate, within 14 days of the date on which this Contract has been terminated.
This clause shall not apply to the virtual gift card, for which the delivery is governed by the Terms and Conditions of the Gift Card and clause 9 above.
11.
INSTANT DELIVERY
If you have chosen the delivery at store option, we may subsequently notify you that our “Instant Delivery” service is available for the items in your order, but as this is subject to stock availability and other factors, it cannot be chosen by you when you place your order.
If we have notified you that “Instant Delivery” is available, your order will be available to be picked up by you from that store before the estimated delivery dates that are stated in the Buying Guide section of our website.
Once your “Instant Delivery” order has been prepared, we will contact you to let you know that it is ready to be picked up.
You can pick up the order either in person (by presenting the order number and a proof of identity) or you can appoint someone else to pick up the order on your behalf.
In this case, the appointed person must present the order number and proof of his or her identity.
The terms of this Clause 11 (together with the rest of these Terms) will apply to you if you make a purchase via the “Instant Delivery” service, and will be subject to any other applicable regulations.
12.
PRE-ORDER ITEMS
We may make it possible to order items through our website before we have them in stock (“Pre-OrderItems”).
When you order Pre-Order Items:
(a) they will typically be delivered within thirty (30) days of the date of your Order Confirmation; any longer delivery times will be shown on the website at the time you place your order;
(b) we will e-mail you a Shipping Confirmation when we have sent the Pre-Order Items out to you;
(c) they may be delivered in separate packages, and at different times, to any other items which you order; and
(d) you may cancel your order in the same way as any other order, see Clause 17 below for full details.
13.
RISK AND TITLE
The Items will be at your risk from the time of delivery.
Ownership of the items will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the items, including delivery charges, or upon delivery (as defined in Clause 9), whichever is the later.
14.
PRICE AND PAYMENT
The price of any items will be as stipulated on our website from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.
While we try to ensure that all prices on this website are accurate, errors may occur.
If we discover an error in the price of items you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming the order at the correct price or cancelling it.
If we are unable to contact you, the order will be treated as cancelled and if you have already paid for the items you will receive a full refund.
We are under no obligation to provide the items to you at the incorrect (lower) price (even after we have sent you a Shipping Confirmation) if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an incorrect price.
The prices on this website include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due as set out in our Buying Guide.
Prices are liable to change at any time, but (other than as set out above) changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you an Order Confirmation.
Therefore, except as provided above, price adjustments on previous orders are not permitted.
Once you have finished shopping, all the items you wish to purchase are added to your basket and your next step will be to go to the checkout process and make payment.
To do this, you must follow the steps of the purchase process, completing or verifying the information requested in each step.
Throughout the purchase process, before payment, you can modify the details of your order.
There is a detailed description of the purchase process in the Buying Guide.
Also, if you are a registered user, a record of all the orders placed by you is available in the "My Account" area.
Payment can be made by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, and Apple Pay (only for iPhone or iPad APP).
You can also pay all or part of the price of your order with a Zara gift card or credit voucher card for the United Kingdom issued by ZARA UK Limited or by Fashion Retail, S.A. (a Spanish company with offices at Avda.
de la Diputación, Edificio Inditex, 15143 Arteixo, A Coruña, Spain).
If you subsequently wish to exchange your order due to "Change of size", this option will only be available if you have used any of the following means of payment: Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.
To minimise the possibility of unauthorised access, your credit card details will be encrypted.
By clicking "Authorise payment" you are confirming that the credit card is yours or that you are the legitimate holder of the gift card or the credit voucher card.
Credit cards are subject to validation checks and authorisation by your card issuer, but if your card issuer fails to authorise payment to us, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery and may not be able to form a contract with you.
Please note that Fashion Retail, S.A. of Avenida de la Diputación, Edificio Inditex, Arteixo, A Coruña, Spain, registered in the commercial register of A Coruña, vol.
3425, page 49, C-47731, 1st entry, and tax identification number A-70301981, will collect and make refunds on behalf of Zara UK Limited in relation to all payments made through this online platform.
Ordering through electronic devices in store, and making payment for those purchases
If you are placing your order through one of the electronic devices that are available at certain ZARA stores in the United Kingdom for this purpose, you must follow the steps of the purchase process that appear on the device, completing or verifying the information requested in each step.
Throughout the purchase process, before payment, you can modify the details of your order.
You must choose your payment method, and whether or not you require a gift receipt (if one is available), before you place your order.
Please note that a binding order is placed at the time that you press the relevant "Authorise Payment" button on the device screen, and you are required to pay for your order once it has been placed.
Payment can be made by Visa, Mastercard, or American Express card, and the above provisions regarding validation checks and authorisation of your card will apply.
You may also be given the option to pay for your order at the till, and in which case, your payment can be made by any of the means of payment available in those stores.
Please note that if you place your order through an instore electronic device, but wish to cancel the order, you must pay for the order and wait for the items to be delivered, before returning them in accordance with the returns policy described below.

Acceptable handling of the items is that which would reasonably be allowed in a shop.
Items should not have been damaged, soiled, washed, altered or worn (other than to try the item on) and any labels or tags must be intact.
If your handling goes beyond what is acceptable and the items are damaged or diminished in value, we may deduct from the amount we reimburse to you, or you may be liable to us for, an amount equal to the diminished value of the items.
Please return the items using or including all their original packaging, instructions, and other documents, if any, accompanying the items.
Returns Methods
To return an item, just choose one of the three free and flexible return options below:
a) Returns at any ZARA store
You may return any item at any ZARA store in the UK which has the same section to which the items you wish to return belong to.

You can present the e-ticket either by showing it in digital form on your mobile phone, or by bringing to the store a print-out of the e-ticket.
Return of items ordered through electronic devices in store, paid for at the till
Please note that in respect of orders that were originally placed through an electronic device in a Zara store in the UK and that were paid for at the till of that store, returns can only take place in any Zara store in the UK, and not via methods b) and c) below, or any other method.
b) Returns by Courier
We can arrange for a courier to collect the item that you wish to return.
In order to do this, you should access the "My Account > Orders and returns" section of the website and request a return.
You must send the item in the same package that you received it, and follow the directions on the “Returns” section of this website.
If you have bought any items as a guest, you may request returns by courier through the link sent to you in the order confirmation email.
c) Returns to UK Post Office or Royal Mail collection sites
You can request from us a pre-paid postage label for you to be able to attach to the parcel and drop your parcel off at your local Post Office, or Royal Mail collection site, in the UK.

Please bear in mind that if you wish to return the items to us freight collect/cash on delivery, we may charge you any costs incurred in such return.
After examining the items, we will inform you of whether you have the right to reimbursement of the amounts paid.

The refund will be paid as soon as possible and, in all cases, within 14 days from the date on which you notified us of your intention to cancel.

The refund will always be paid using the same payment means you used to pay for your purchase.
You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the items to us, as indicated above.
If you have any questions, you can contact us via the live webchat available 24/7 via our website, or by calling 0800 030 4238.
Exchanges – for a change of size
If you decide that the item that you have purchased is in the wrong size for you, then you may be able to request a change in its size, without having to pay an additional delivery charge for the new item being sent to you, provided that you return the original item.
This option is irrespective of your right of withdrawal, which will continue to exist legally and contractually.
You can request the change of size via the "Orders and Exchanges" section of "My Account" on this website.
You should select the new size of your item, and provided that (1) it is the same item; (2) its price on this website is equal to, or greater than, the price that you paid for the original item (but please note, in these circumstances only, you will not be charged for the price); (3) the means of payment that you originally used is one of those specified as such in Clause 13 of these Term; (4) you do not have any other open exchange requests; and (5) you are not requesting more than 5 items to be exchanged; then you will be able to request the change in size.
Please note that the option for you to change the size of your original item will only be displayed as being available to you when all five of these conditions are met.
Once you have requested the exchange, and selected the appropriate returns method, you must return the original item, either to any Zara store in the UK, or via a courier that we send to your home, or by dropping it off at a Post Office, or Royal Mail collection site, in the UK, using a returns-paid label that we can supply to you.
You must return the item without any undue delay, and in any event within a maximum period of 14 calendar days from making the exchange request via this website.
Neither of these three options for returning the item will generate additional costs for you.
If you want to return the original item at any Zara store in the UK, you must present, as well as the original item, the e-ticket that was attached to the Shipping Confirmation, which is also saved under your account on our website, and on the Zara mobile app.
You can present the e-ticket either by showing it in digital form on your mobile phone, or by bringing to the store a print-out of the e-ticket.
If you want to return the item by courier arranged by us, you should return it in the same package that you received it, and follow the directions on the "Orders and Exchanges" section of the Buying Guide.
If you want to return the item at your local Post Office or Royal Mail collection site, in the UK, you should contact us to arrange for us to send you a pre-paid postage label, and return it in the same package that you received it, with the pre-paid postage label attached, following the directions on the "Orders and Exchanges" section of the Buying Guide.
After you have chosen your return method, we will aim to send your new order to you, of the item in its revised size, within 2-3 working days from the date of request of the exchange, and in any event within a maximum of 30 days from that date.
This option will not present an extra cost to you.
The new order is governed by the provisions of these Terms, including your ability to exercise your right of withdrawal.
Please note that if after 14 calendar days from the date of the exchange request made via this website, you have not returned the original item, we are entitled to charge you the costs corresponding to the new order placed, subject to the provisions of these Terms.
Returns of defective items
If the item that you have received is defective, please notify us by using the live webchat available 24/7 via our website or by calling 0800 030 4238, and return the item in accordance with a) b) or c) above.
Please provide proof of purchase, for example a copy of the E-ticket attached to the Shipping Confirmation.
We will examine the item and if we deem it to be defective, we will provide a full refund including delivery charges, and the refund will be paid using the same means of payment that you originally used to pay for your purchase.
These provisions do not limit any applicable statutory rights.
Returns of non-Zara items
You are responsible for checking the contents of any packages before you return them to us.
We are not responsible for the care or return of the contents of any packages which are erroneously returned to us (which included any products provided by other retailers) (“Erroneous Returns”).
We may (but are not required to) contact you to inform you that you have made an Erroneous Return.
We will store any Erroneous Returns which we receive for a period of 14 days from the date we receive them.
If you have not contacted us regarding the Erroneous Return within this time we will presume that the relevant contents have been abandoned.
We reserve the right to destroy any such Erroneous Returns without notice to you.
Given the volume of returns we process, we do not promise that we will be able to locate all Erroneous Returns we receive.
If we are able to locate an Erroneous Return, we will take reasonable measures to return the relevant contents to you, but reserve the right to first require you to reimburse us for our reasonable costs in processing, storing and returning those contents to you.
RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL
You have the right to withdraw from your order within 14 days, without giving any reason, although please note you have no right to withdraw items that are classed as 'Excluded Items' as mentioned above.
The withdrawal period is counted from the day of the delivery of the last item(s) in your order.
The easiest way to exercise your right of withdrawal is to contact us by using the live webchat available 24/7 via our website or by calling Freephone 0800 030 4238, and returning the goods to us using one of the three returns methods described above.
However, to meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to let us know about your decision to withdraw from your order before the withdrawal period has expired.
You may also use the model cancellation form as set out in the Appendix to these terms, although it is not obligatory.
If you have ordered items from outside the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, from another EU member state via this website, then: - the provisions of this Clause 17 shall apply regarding withdrawal, returns and exchanges, save that the "Returns by Courier" option can only be selected if it is from the original delivery address within the UK or Isle of Man; and - we are under no obligation to repay shipping costs to destinations other than to the original UK/Isle of Man delivery address, nor will we repay the return costs from destinations outside the United Kingdom or Isle of Man; except if the item is defective, in which case the provisions of the paragraph above entitled "Returns of defective items" will apply in all cases.
Effects of withdrawal
We will refund all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery to the original delivery address (although we will not refund any supplementary delivery costs if you chose an enhanced type of delivery rather than our least expensive type of standard delivery), without undue delay and in any event no later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw.
We will use the same means of payment that you used to pay for your order and this will not cause you any extra fees.
We may withhold the refund until we have received the items back, or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the items, whichever is the earlier.
You must send back the items or hand them over to us without undue delay, and in any event no later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw.
Please use one of the three returns methods described above.
If you do not use one of these three returns methods, you will need to bear the cost of returning the items to us.
You are only liable for any diminished value of the items resulting from their handling, other than that which is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the items.
