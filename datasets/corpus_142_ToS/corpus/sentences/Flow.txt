To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Use (“Dispute”), you and Flow agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided in Section 17.D below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.

Such arbitration shall be conducted in Sweden in the English or Swedish language.

The arbitrators shall award only such damages as are permitted to be awarded pursuant to these Terms of Use, each party expressly waives and foregoes any right to punitive, exemplary or similar damages unless applicable law prohibits such waiver.
The arbitrators must render their award within thirty (30) days following the last hearing scheduled by the arbitrators and at that time state the reasons for their award in writing.
An appeal may be taken under the CPR Arbitration Appeal Procedure from any final award of an arbitral panel in any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms of Use that is conducted in accordance with such procedure.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the appeal tribunal, the appeal shall be conducted at the place of the original arbitration.
C. Restrictions .
You and Flow agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Flow and you individually.
To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
Any Dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Sweden, and you hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
D. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration .
You and Flow agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Flow’s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
